EECE2140 Final Project

The main program accepts a class roster in the form of an excel file and a txt file containing pre-defined inputs and expected output as parameters.
Excel format: First name, Last name, File path of assignment folder, Grades.
Text file format: Script-file-name|input input ...|output.
The programs students submit must match the name as written in the text file, otherwise they will not receive credit.
